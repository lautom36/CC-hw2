1.  Why is possible that Update and Delete Widget Requests may fail, even when you were 
    running just one Consumer? 

    Since its not a FIFO queue there is a chance for requests to get out of order so there 
    may be a update request for a widget that has not been created yet.

2.  How would this possible behavior impact the design of distributed applications that use 
    queues? 

    It may be that you need to requeue requests so that they can happen "in order".
    Also if you have really important requests for stuff like transactions you most likely
    want to stay away from queues so that things dont have a chance to happen out of order.
